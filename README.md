This is a simple bouncing ball example for assignment 1 built using three.js

- [Demo](http://subsid.github.io/bouncing-ball/)
- Simulation is done using Euler integration with additional forces such as gravity, air resistance, friction, collision detection.
- Some implementation ideas were taken from [dlebech's project](https://github.com/dlebech/ball-webgl)
